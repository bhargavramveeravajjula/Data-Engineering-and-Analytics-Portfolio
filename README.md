# About Me

Data Engineer & Analyst | Data Enthusiast
Iâ€™m currently building expertise in data engineering and data analysis, focusing on end-to-end data pipelines, ETL/ELT workflows, and scalable data solutions. My learning journey includes:

Data Engineering: Designing robust pipelines with tools like Apache Spark, Databricks, Airflow, and SQL/NoSQL databases.

Data Analysis: Extracting actionable insights using Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

Cloud Platforms: Exploring AWS and Azure for cloud-native data solutions.

I thrive on hands-on projects that bridge raw data and business value, combining engineering rigor with analytical storytelling.

ðŸ‘¯ Collaboration Goals
Iâ€™m excited to collaborate on:

Data Engineering: Building scalable pipelines, optimizing ETL workflows, or working with Delta Lake/Snowflake for modern data warehousing.

Data Analysis: Solving business problems through statistical modeling, dashboard creation, or A/B testing.

Open-Source Tools: Contributing to projects involving Apache Kafka, dbt, or Great Expectations for data quality.

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re working on real-time data processing, cloud migrations, or MLOps pipelines!

ðŸ¤” Areas for Growth
Iâ€™m actively deepening my knowledge of:

Advanced Data Engineering: Orchestration (Airflow/Dagster), distributed systems (Spark), and streaming (Kafka).

Big Data: Handling large datasets with Hadoop/PySpark and optimizing query performance.

DataOps: Implementing CI/CD for data pipelines and mastering IaC (Terraform).

Mentorship or collaboration on real-world data challenges would be invaluable!

ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About
Data Engineering: ETL design, data modeling (Kimball/Inmon), or tools like Databricks/Delta Lake.

Data Analysis: SQL optimization, Python automation, or Power BI/Tableau visualization best practices.

Career Tips: Transitioning into data roles, balancing engineering and analysis skills, or building a data portfolio.

P.S. I love geeking out about data trends (lakehouses, LLMs in BI) and data quality frameworks!

ðŸŒŸ Why Work With Me?
Hybrid Skillset: I bridge the gap between engineering (building pipelines) and analysis (deriving insights).

Problem-Solver: From debugging a broken Airflow DAG to optimizing a slow SQL query, I enjoy untangling data puzzles.

Data Advocacy: I believe clean, well-engineered data is the foundation of impactful analytics.
